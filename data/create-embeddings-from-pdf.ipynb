Both DC and AC high voltage are very dangerous and can cause personal injury, severe burns, electric shock and even fatal injury. To avoid personal injury, please follow all caution labels attached to high-voltage parts. Do not touch or attempt to remove or replace any high-voltage (orange-colored) wiring and connectors. Do not touch the service plug, which is located under the rear seat. If an accident occurs, do not touch any high-voltage wiring, connectors or parts such as the inverter unit or hybrid vehicle battery assembly. Do not touch the potassium hydroxide electrolyte that might spill or leak from the hybrid vehicle battery as the result of an accident. If potassium hydroxide electrolyte gets on your skin or in your eyes, neutralize it immediately with a saturated boric acid solution (ratio: 80 grams boric acid to two liters water). Seek immediate medical attention. If a vehicle fire occurs, extinguish it with a Class D powder-type fire extinguisher. Toyota recommends having maintenance and repairs for your Venza performed by an authorized Toyota dealership. To locate your nearest authorized Toyota dealership, contact the Toyota Brand Engagement Center at (800) 331-4331 or log on to www.toyota.com . 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza COVER_R1.indd 2134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza COVER_R1.indd 2 9/14/22 4:45 AM9/14/22 4:45 AM1WELCOME TO THE TOYOTA FAMILY Thank you for purchasing a Toyota vehicle.

Your complete satisfaction is our first priority. Should you have a problem or concern either during or after the warranty period please take the following steps to ensure the quickest possible response: Step 1 Discuss the situation with a dealership manager, such as the service manager or customer relations manager. In most cases, a satisfactory solution can be reached at this step. Step 2 If the dealership does not address your concern to your satisfaction, call the Toyota Brand Engagement Center at (800) 331-4331. Please have the following information ready when you call: Your Toyotas vehicle identification number (located on the drivers side corner of the dashboard, under the windshield) Current mileage on your vehicle Name of your Toyota dealership A Toyota customer relations representative will assist you in working with the dealership to find a satisfactory solution.Step 3 If your concern has still not been resolved to your satisfaction, Toyota offers additional assistance through the Dispute Settlement Program, a dispute resolution program administered by the National Center for Dispute Settlement. The purpose of the Dispute Settlement Program is to resolve disputes through arbitration a process by which two parties authorize an independent third party to hear and resolve a dispute. The program is informal and free of charge. To request that your case be reviewed through the program, complete the customer claim form in the Owners Warranty Rights Notification booklet (found in your glove box) and mail it to: National Center for Dispute Settlement P.O. Box 515284Dallas, TX 75251-5284 To initiate arbitration, you must complete an NCDS customer claim form and mail it to NCDS. To request a form, call NCDS at (800) 777-8119 or obtain a copy at www.ncdsusa.org. When you call, please have your vehicle identification number, the current mileage on your Toyota and the names of your selling and servicing dealerships. 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 5134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 5 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM6 IntroductionIF YOU NEED ASSISTANCEINTRODUCTIONCalifornia residents: Toyota offers assistance through an informal dispute settlement program called the California Dispute Settlement Program (CDSP). A brochure about the program is found in your glove box. For additional information, call the Toyota Brand Engagement Center at (800) 331-4331. You may also contact the CDSP directly at (888) 300-6237. Failure to use the CDSP may affect your rights and remedies under Californias Lemon Laws. This information about the Dispute Settlement Programs is correct as of the date of printing. However, the programs may be changed without notice. For the most current information about the programs, call the Toyota Brand Engagement Center at (800) 331-4331. 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 6134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 6 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM7 IntroductionINTRODUCTIONTHE IMMOBILIZER KEY THE NEW WORLD OF ANTI-THEFT TECHNOLOGY This Toyota vehicle may be equipped with an electronic immobilizer anti-theft system. When the key is inserted into the ignition switch, it transmits an electronic code to an immobilizer computer. The engine will only start if the code in the key matches the code in the immobilizer. If the code does not match, the immobilizer disables the ignition and fuel systems. While an exact physical copy of the key will open the door and allow retrieval of items locked in the vehicle, it wont start the vehicle unless the key has the same code as the immobilizer. SECURITY For security purposes, access to key codes and service procedures for electronically registering replacement keys is restricted. Only a Toyota dealer or certain bonded/registered independent locksmiths can generate replacement keys. 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 7134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 7 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM8 IntroductionINTRODUCTION REPLACING THE KEY Upon purchase, each vehicle should have two master keys and an aluminum tag with a key code imprinted on it. To generate a fully functional replacement key (one that will both open the doors and start the engine), one of the master keys is required. To make a key that will open the door for retrieval of items locked inside the vehicle, the aluminum key-code tag can be used. If a master key or the aluminum key-code tag is not available, a Toyota dealer or certain registered locksmiths can obtain the key code from a restricted-access database. These businesses can also access a service utility to reprogram the immobilizer if all registered master keys have been lost. If a Toyota dealer is not available, please refer to www.aloa.org to find a bonded/registered locksmith who performs high-security key service. KEEPING THE KEY SAFE Replacing an immobilizer key may be costly. It is advisable to keep a spare master key and the aluminum key-code tag in a safe place. If you record the key code in more than one place, do not record it in a way that can be easily identified and associated with the vehicle. It is wise to keep a copy of the key code outside of the vehicle. If the vehicle was delivered with less than two keys and the aluminum key-code tag, consider having the Toyota dealer or a qualified independent automotive locksmith make a duplicate key before you need it..THE IMMOBILIZER KEY 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 8134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 8 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM9 IntroductionINTRODUCTIONWe realize that your confidence in the quality and reliability of our products was a key factor in your decision to buy a Toyota. We also know how disruptive the loss of transportation can be to your daily routine. Thats why were pleased to offer you the benefits of our Transportation Assistance Policy. Under this policy, you are eligible for transportation assistance if your Toyota must be kept overnight for warranty-covered repairs. The policy applies when your vehicle must be kept overnight for any of the following reasons: The warranty repairs will take longer than one day to complete. The warrantable condition requires extensive diagnosis. The parts needed for the warranty repairs are not readily available and your vehicle is inoperative or unsafe to drive.The policy does not apply when warranty repairs can be completed in one day but the vehicle must be kept overnight due to dealer or owner scheduling conflicts. The Transportation Assistance Policy applies for the duration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.

For your convenience, a maintenance log is included in this booklet. If you sell your vehicle, you should give your maintenance records to the new owner.

However, damage or failure caused by lack of proper maintenance is not covered under warranty. WHERE TO GO FOR MAINTENANCE You may have maintenance performed on your vehicle by any qualified person or facility. However, Toyota recommends having maintenance performed by an authorized Toyota dealership. Toyota dealership technicians are specially trained to maintain and repair Toyota vehicles.

Many are also certified through the Toyota Certification Program, which involves a series of rigorous written examinations. Feel free to ask any Toyota dealership to show you their technicians credentials. You can be confident youre getting the best possible service for your vehicle when you take it to a Toyota dealership. 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 31134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 31 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM32 Your ResponsibilitiesWARRANTYOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REPLACEMENT PARTS Warranty coverage is not dependent upon the use of any particular brand of replacement parts. However, Toyota recommends using only Toyota Genuine Parts when you need to replace a part on your vehicle. Like all Toyota products, Toyota Genuine Parts are built to the highest standards of quality, durability and performance. They are also designed to fit your vehicles exact specifications. Your Toyota dealership maintains an extensive inventory of Toyota Genuine Parts to meet your vehicle service needs. And because it is linked electronically to Toyotas Parts Distribution Centers, the dealership has quick access to any parts it may not have in stock. Toyota Genuine Parts are covered by their own warranty (see your dealer for details) or the remainder of any applicable New Vehicle Limited Warranty, whichever is longer. Parts that are not Toyota Genuine Parts, or any damage or failures resulting from their use, are not covered by any Toyota warranty. 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 32134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 32 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM33 Your ResponsibilitiesOBTAINING WARRANTY SERVICEWARRANTYBY GEOGRAPHIC REGION In the United States, U.S. Territories, Canada and Mexico To obtain warranty service in the United States, U.S. territories, Canada or Mexico, take your vehicle to an authorized Toyota dealership. If your vehicle cannot be driven, contact your nearest Toyota dealership for towing assistance. You do not have to pay for towing to the nearest Toyota dealership if your vehicle is inoperable due to failure of a warranted part. Outside the United States, U.S. Territories, Canada and Mexico If you are using your vehicle outside the United States, U.S. territories, Canada and Mexico and need warranty service, contact a local Toyota dealership. Please note, however, that your vehicle may not be repaired free of charge because the local Toyota distributor may have no obligation to provide warranty service for your vehicle, and/or your vehicle may not comply with local regulatory or environmental requirements.EMERGENCY REPAIRS If your vehicle is inoperable or unsafe to drive and there is no Toyota dealership reasonably available to make repairs, you may perform the repairs yourself or have them performed by another automotive service provider. Toyota will reimburse you for any of the repairs that are covered by warranty. To receive reimbursement, present to an authorized Toyota dealership your paid repair invoices and any parts that were removed from the vehicle. You will be reimbursed for warranted parts at the manufacturers suggested retail price and warranted labor at a geographically appropriate hourly rate multiplied by Toyotas recommended time allowance for the repair. If your vehicle requires emergency repair, Toyota assumes no liability for subsequent failures caused by improper repairs or the use of parts that are not Toyota Genuine Parts unless you have the vehicle properly repaired in a timely manner. To ensure that warranty coverage remains intact, have your vehicle inspected by an authorized Toyota dealership as soon as possible after an emergency repair. 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 33134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 33 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM34 Maintenance LogMAINTENANCETHE IMPORTANCE OF SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE Regular maintenance is essential to obtaining the highest level of performance, safety and reliability from your Toyota.

These special operating conditions and their required maintenance items are clearly indicated in each chart. NOTE:You should perform these additional maintenance services only if the majority of your driving is done under the special operating conditions indicated. If you only occasionally drive under these circumstances, it is not necessary to perform the additional services. Engine Oil Selection Please refer to your Owners Manual for the specific oil viscosity rating recommended for your vehicle/engine type. Additional Maintenance In addition to scheduled maintenance, your Toyota requires ongoing general maintenance, such as fluid checks and visual inspections. These procedures are explained in the Maintenance and Care section of the Owner s Manual. Be sure to perform these procedures regularly to ensure the most trouble-free operation of your vehicle.SuperChrome and Alloy Wheel Care If you purchased Genuine Toyota Accessory SuperChrome or Aluminum Alloy Wheels, follow these cleaning guidelines to maintain the appearance of your wheels: If wheels are hot, wait for them to cool before washing. Use a soft sponge or cotton cloth to apply the same mild car-wash soap as used for the vehicle body. Quickly rinse off with water. Use a soft cloth to apply the same car wax as used for the vehicle body. DO NOT USE: Any kind of chemical- based cleaners, alcohol, solvents, gasoline, steam cleaners, scouring pads, wire brushes or coarse abrasives to clean your wheels.USING THE MAINTENANCE LOG CHARTS 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 37134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 37 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM38 Maintenance LogMAINTENANCE LOGMAINTENANCE5,000 miles or 6 months Add Toyota EFI Tank Additive or equivalent (Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Saipan only) Check installation of drivers floor mat Inspect and adjust all fluid levels1 Inspect HV battery cooling intake fi lter5 Inspect wiper blades Rotate tires Visually inspect brake linings/drums and brake pads/discs Additional Maintenance Items for Special Operating Conditions 3 Driving on dirt roads or dusty roads: Inspect ball joints and dust covers Inspect drive shaft boots Inspect engine air filter Inspect steering linkage and boots Replace engine oil and oil filter2 Tighten nuts and bolts on chassis and body Driving while towing, using a car-top carrier, or heavy vehicle loading: 6 Tighten nuts and bolts on chassis and body 10,000 miles or 12 months ) Add Toyota EFI Tank Additive or equivalent (Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Saipan only) Check installation of drivers floor mat Inspect and adjust all fluid levels1 Inspect HV battery cooling intake fi lter5 Inspect wiper blades Replace engine oil and oil filter2 Rotate tires Visually inspect brake linings/drums and brake pads/discs Additional Maintenance Items for Special Operating Conditions 3 Driving on dirt roads or dusty roads: Inspect ball joints and dust covers Inspect drive shaft boots Inspect engine air filter Inspect steering linkage and boots Tighten nuts and bolts on chassis and body Driving while towing, using a car-top carrier, or heavy vehicle loading: 6 Tighten nuts and bolts on chassis and body Dealer Service verification : Date: Mileage :Dealer Service verification : Date: Mileage : 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 38134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 38 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM39 Maintenance LogMAINTENANCE LOGMAINTENANCE15,000 miles or 18 months Add Toyota EFI Tank Additive or equivalent (Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Saipan only) Check installation of drivers floor mat Inspect and adjust all fluid levels1 Inspect HV battery cooling intake fi lter5 Inspect wiper blades Rotate tires Visually inspect brake linings/drums and brake pads/discs NOTE: If 0W-16 oil WAS NOT used at the last oil change, replace engine oil and oil filter.2 Inspect the following: _Ball joints and dust covers _ Exhaust pipes and mountings _Brake lines and hoses _ Radiator, condenser and/or intercooler _Cabin air filter _ Steering gear _Drive shaft boots _ Steering linkage and boots _Engine/Inverter coolant4 Additional Maintenance Items for Special Operating Conditions3 Driving on dirt roads or dusty roads: Inspect engine air filter Replace engine oil and oil filter2 Tighten nuts and bolts on chassis and body Driving while towing, using a car-top carrier, or heavy vehicle loading:6 Tighten nuts and bolts on chassis and body Dealer Service verification : Date: Mileage : 1 Inspect sealed transmissions, transfer cases and differentials for signs of leakage.

Both DC and AC high voltage are very dangerous and can cause personal injury, severe burns, electric shock and even fatal injury. To avoid personal injury, please follow all caution labels attached to high-voltage parts. Do not touch or attempt to remove or replace any high-voltage (orange-colored) wiring and connectors. Do not touch the service plug, which is located under the rear seat. If an accident occurs, do not touch any high-voltage wiring, connectors or parts such as the inverter unit or hybrid vehicle battery assembly. Do not touch the potassium hydroxide electrolyte that might spill or leak from the hybrid vehicle battery as the result of an accident. If potassium hydroxide electrolyte gets on your skin or in your eyes, neutralize it immediately with a saturated boric acid solution (ratio: 80 grams boric acid to two liters water). Seek immediate medical attention. If a vehicle fire occurs, extinguish it with a Class D powder-type fire extinguisher.

When the brakes are applied, the braking force generates electricity, which is then sent to the traction battery to conserve energy. In addition, the engine shuts off when the vehicle is stopped. The benefits are better fuel economy and reduced vehicle emissions. NOTE: Fuel consumption and energy information of the Hybrid System are shown on the Multi-Information Display (MID) and the Multimedia display. - Ensure tire pressures are maintained at levels specified in the Owners Manual.- Link trips to reduce engine cold starts whenever possible.- Avoid driving at speeds that are higher than necessary, especially on the highway.- When possible, avoid sudden stops to maximize regenerative braking energy.- Minimize use of the Air Conditioning. (1)Put the shift lever in Park. (2)Depress the brake pedal, and and a message will be displayed on the Multi-Information Display (MID). (3) Press the POWER button briefly and firmly.(4)Continue depressing the brake pedal until the READY indicator is illuminated. If the READY indicator turns on, the hybrid system will operate normally.

For more information, please go to www.toyota.com/safety-sense.Quick overview-Toyota Safety Sense 2.5+ Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD) PCS w/PD is designed to provide alert, mitigation, and/or avoidance support in certain conditions, when the system determines there is potential for a collision with a detected object. The advanced grille-mounted radar system is designed to work with the forward-facing camera to help recognize a preceding vehicle, pedestrian or bicyclist in certain conditions. Automatic High Beams (AHB) AHB is designed to detect the headlights of oncoming vehicles and the taillights of preceding vehicles and switch between high beams and low beams as appropriate. Road Sign Assist (RSA)RSA is designed to recognize specific road signs using the forward-facing camera to provide information to the driver via the display.Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)Full-Speed Range DRCC is designed to help maintain a pre-set distance to a preceding vehicle when the preceding vehicle is traveling at a lower speed. The minimum set speed is approximately 20 MPH. Lane Tracing Assist (LTA) SystemWhile driving on a road with clear white (yellow) lane lines, the LTA system warns the driver if the vehicle may deviate from the current lane or course, and also can slightly operate the steering wheel to help avoid deviation from the lane or course. Also, while the dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range is operating, this system will operate the steering wheel to help maintain the vehicles lane position. Functions included in the LTA system are Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist, Vehicle Sway Warning and Lane Centering. MY23_Venza_QRG_V2_ML_0910_PRINT.indd 37 9/13/22 9:22 AM38Grille-mounted radarForward-facing cameraSensors TSS 2.5+ combines a forward-facing camera mounted in front of the inside rear view mirror and a grille-mounted radar mounted in the front grille. These sensors support the driving assist systems. The Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD) is designed to help detect a vehicle, bicyclist or a pedestrian in certain situations. Using both a camera and radar, PCS w/ PD can provide an audio/visual alert to warn you of a possible collision under certain circumstances. If you dont react, the system is designed to automatically brake. As there is a limit to the degree of recognition accuracy and control performance that this system can provide, do not overly rely on this system. This system will not prevent collisions or lessen collision damage or injury in every situation. Do not use PCS instead of normal braking operations under any circumstances. Do not attempt to test the operation of the Pre-Collision System yourself, as the system may not operate or engage, possibly leading to an accident. In some situations, such as when driving in inclement weather such as heavy rain, fog, snow or a sandstorm or while driving on a curve and for a few seconds after driving on a curve, a vehicle, pedestrian or bicyclist may not be detected by the radar and camera sensors, preventing the system from operating or engaging properly. See www.toyota.com/safety-sense for more information.Refer to the Toyota Owners Manual for a list of additional situations in which the system operation may be limited.Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD)TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE front grille-mounted radar.

Refer to the Toyota Owners Manual for additional limitations and information.Under certain conditions, the PCS included with the TSS 2.5+ package may also help to detect a pedestrian or bicyclist in front of your vehicle using the forward-facing camera and the front grille-mounted radar. The forward-facing camera of PCS detects a potential pedestrian or bicyclist based on size, profile, and motion of the detected pedestrian or bicyclist. However, a pedestrian or bicyclist may not be detected depending on the conditions, including the surrounding brightness and the motion, posture, size, and angle of the potential detected pedestrian or bicyclist, preventing the system from operating or engaging. PCS PEDESTRIAN DETECTIONPre-Collision WarningWhen the system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision is high, a buzzer will sound and a warning message will be displayed on the Multi-Information Display (MID) to urge the driver to take evasive action. Pre-Collision Brake Assist If the driver notices the hazard and brakes, the system may provide additional braking force using Brake Assist. This system may prime the brakes and may apply greater braking force in relation to how strongly the brake pedal is depressed. Pre-Collision Braking If the driver does not brake in a set time and the system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision with a preceding vehicle is extremely high, the system may automatically apply the brakes, reducing speed in order to help the driver reduce the impact and in certain cases avoid the collision.

If the system has not initialized turn off the light.Tire Pressure Monitoring (warning) (TPMS) *1 7-in display, *2Star Safety System ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM (ABS) Toyotas Anti-lock Brake System detects which wheels are locking up and limits wheel lockup by pulsing each wheels brakes independently. Pulsing releases brake pressure repeatedly for fractions of a second. This helps the tires attain the traction that current road conditions will allow, helping you to stay in directional control. BRAKE ASSIST (BA) Brake Assist is designed to detect sudden or panic braking, and then add braking pressure to help decrease the vehicles stopping distance. When theres only a split second to react, Brake Assist can add additional brake pressure more quickly than just the driver alone can. ELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE DISTRIBUTION (EBD) Toyotas ABS technology has Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) to help maintain control and balance when braking. EBD responds to sudden stops by redistributing brake force to enhance the braking effectiveness of all four wheels.Your vehicle comes standard with the Star Safety System TM, which combines Anti- lock Braking System (ABS), Brake Assist (BA), Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Smart Stop Technology (SST), Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Traction Control (TRAC). Refer to the Owners Manual for more details and important information on limitations to these systems. SMART STOP TECHNOLOGY (SST) Smart Stop Technology automatically reduces engine power when the accelerator and brake pedals are pressed simultaneously under certain conditions. SST engages when the accelerator is depressed first and the brakes are applied firmly for longer than one-half second at speeds greater than five miles per hour. SST doesnt engage if the brake pedal is depressed before the accelerator pedal, allowing vehicles to start on a steep hill and safely accelerate without rolling backward. ENHANCED VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL (VSC) Enhanced Vehicle Stability Control provides cooperative control of the ABS, TRAC, VSC and EPS. Enhanced VSC helps to maintain directional stability when loss of traction occurs during a turn. MY23_Venza_QRG_V2_ML_0910_PRINT.indd 57 9/13/22 9:22 AM58Floor mat installationSAFETY & EMERGENCY FEATURES There are two types of Toyota floor mats: carpeted and all-weather. Each vehicle has model-specific floor mats. Installation is easy. To keep your floor mat properly positioned, follow these steps:Only use Toyota floor mats designed for your specific model. Only use one floor mat at a time, using the equipped fasteners to keep the mat in place. Install floor mats right side up.TRACTION CONTROL (TRAC) VSC helps prevent loss of traction during cornering by reducing engine power, and Traction Control helps maintain traction on loose gravel and wet, icy, or uneven surfaces by applying brake force to the spinning wheel(s). Toyotas TRAC sensors are activated when one of the drive wheels starts to slip. TRAC limits engine output and applies the brakes to the spinning wheel. This transfers power to the wheels that still have traction to help keep you on track. Always align the marks MY23_Venza_QRG_V2_ML_0910_PRINT.indd 58 9/13/22 9:22 AM59Floor mat installation has model-specific floor mats. Installation is easy.

Both DC and AC high voltage are very dangerous and can cause personal injury, severe burns, electric shock and even fatal injury. To avoid personal injury, please follow all caution labels attached to high-voltage parts. Do not touch or attempt to remove or replace any high-voltage (orange-colored) wiring and connectors. Do not touch the service plug, which is located under the rear seat. If an accident occurs, do not touch any high-voltage wiring, connectors or parts such as the inverter unit or hybrid vehicle battery assembly. Do not touch the potassium hydroxide electrolyte that might spill or leak from the hybrid vehicle battery as the result of an accident. If potassium hydroxide electrolyte gets on your skin or in your eyes, neutralize it immediately with a saturated boric acid solution (ratio: 80 grams boric acid to two liters water). Seek immediate medical attention. If a vehicle fire occurs, extinguish it with a Class D powder-type fire extinguisher. Toyota recommends having maintenance and repairs for your Venza performed by an authorized Toyota dealership. To locate your nearest authorized Toyota dealership, contact the Toyota Brand Engagement Center at (800) 331-4331 or log on to www.toyota.com . 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza COVER_R1.indd 2134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza COVER_R1.indd 2 9/14/22 4:45 AM9/14/22 4:45 AM1WELCOME TO THE TOYOTA FAMILY Thank you for purchasing a Toyota vehicle.

Your complete satisfaction is our first priority. Should you have a problem or concern either during or after the warranty period please take the following steps to ensure the quickest possible response: Step 1 Discuss the situation with a dealership manager, such as the service manager or customer relations manager.

Please have the following information ready when you call: Your Toyotas vehicle identification number (located on the drivers side corner of the dashboard, under the windshield) Current mileage on your vehicle Name of your Toyota dealership A Toyota customer relations representative will assist you in working with the dealership to find a satisfactory solution.Step 3 If your concern has still not been resolved to your satisfaction, Toyota offers additional assistance through the Dispute Settlement Program, a dispute resolution program administered by the National Center for Dispute Settlement. The purpose of the Dispute Settlement Program is to resolve disputes through arbitration a process by which two parties authorize an independent third party to hear and resolve a dispute. The program is informal and free of charge. To request that your case be reviewed through the program, complete the customer claim form in the Owners Warranty Rights Notification booklet (found in your glove box) and mail it to: National Center for Dispute Settlement P.O. Box 515284Dallas, TX 75251-5284 To initiate arbitration, you must complete an NCDS customer claim form and mail it to NCDS.

A brochure about the program is found in your glove box. For additional information, call the Toyota Brand Engagement Center at (800) 331-4331. You may also contact the CDSP directly at (888) 300-6237. Failure to use the CDSP may affect your rights and remedies under Californias Lemon Laws.

When the key is inserted into the ignition switch, it transmits an electronic code to an immobilizer computer. The engine will only start if the code in the key matches the code in the immobilizer. If the code does not match, the immobilizer disables the ignition and fuel systems. While an exact physical copy of the key will open the door and allow retrieval of items locked in the vehicle, it wont start the vehicle unless the key has the same code as the immobilizer. SECURITY For security purposes, access to key codes and service procedures for electronically registering replacement keys is restricted. Only a Toyota dealer or certain bonded/registered independent locksmiths can generate replacement keys. 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 7134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 7 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM8 IntroductionINTRODUCTION REPLACING THE KEY Upon purchase, each vehicle should have two master keys and an aluminum tag with a key code imprinted on it. To generate a fully functional replacement key (one that will both open the doors and start the engine), one of the master keys is required. To make a key that will open the door for retrieval of items locked inside the vehicle, the aluminum key-code tag can be used. If a master key or the aluminum key-code tag is not available, a Toyota dealer or certain registered locksmiths can obtain the key code from a restricted-access database. These businesses can also access a service utility to reprogram the immobilizer if all registered master keys have been lost. If a Toyota dealer is not available, please refer to www.aloa.org to find a bonded/registered locksmith who performs high-security key service. KEEPING THE KEY SAFE Replacing an immobilizer key may be costly. It is advisable to keep a spare master key and the aluminum key-code tag in a safe place. If you record the key code in more than one place, do not record it in a way that can be easily identified and associated with the vehicle. It is wise to keep a copy of the key code outside of the vehicle. If the vehicle was delivered with less than two keys and the aluminum key-code tag, consider having the Toyota dealer or a qualified independent automotive locksmith make a duplicate key before you need it..THE IMMOBILIZER KEY 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 8134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 8 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM9 IntroductionINTRODUCTIONWe realize that your confidence in the quality and reliability of our products was a key factor in your decision to buy a Toyota.

Toyota will not deny a warranty claim solely because you do not have records to show that you maintained your vehicle. However, any failure or noncompliance caused by lack of maintenance is not covered by this warranty. When maintenance and repairs are paid for by you, these services may be performed by you or by any automotive service provider you choose. Toyota will not deny a warranty claim solely because you used a service provider other than a Toyota dealership for maintenance and repairs . However, any failure or noncompliance caused by improper maintenance or repairs is not covered by this warranty. REPLACEMENT PARTS To ensure optimum performance and maintain the quality built into your vehicles emission control systems, Toyota recommends the use of Toyota Genuine Parts when servicing or repairing the systems. Warranty coverage is not dependent upon the use of any particular brand of replacement parts and you may elect to use parts that are not Toyota Genuine Parts for maintenance and repairs. However, use of replacement parts that are not equivalent in quality to Toyota Genuine Parts may impair the effectiveness of the emission control systems. If you use replacement parts that have maintenance or replacement schedules different from those of Toyota Genuine Parts, you must follow the maintenance and replacement schedules for the parts you are using. In addition, you should ensure that such parts are warranted by their manufacturers to be equivalent to Toyota Genuine Parts.FEDERAL EMISSION CONTROL WARRANTY 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 21134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 21 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM22 Your Warranties in DetailWARRANTY IF YOUR VEHICLE FAILS AN EMISSIONS TEST If your vehicle fails an EPA-approved emissions test, you may make a claim under the Emission Performance Warranty.

In addition, you should ensure that such parts are warranted by their manufacturers to be equivalent to Toyota Genuine Parts. IF YOUR VEHICLE FAILS A SMOG-CHECK TEST If your vehicle fails a smog-check test, you may make a claim under the Emission Performance Warranty. To do so, take your vehicle to an authorized Toyota dealership and present a copy of the smog-check test report. Also, take your maintenance records in case they are needed. If your claim qualifies for coverage, the dealership will repair your vehicle within 30 days (unless a shorter period is required by law).

You should keep detailed records of vehicle maintenance, since under some circumstances they may be required for warranty coverage. These records should include date of service, mileage at time of service and a description of service performed and/or parts installed. For your convenience, a maintenance log is included in this booklet. If you sell your vehicle, you should give your maintenance records to the new owner. Toyota will not deny a warranty claim solely because you do not have records to show that you maintained your vehicle. However, damage or failure caused by lack of proper maintenance is not covered under warranty. WHERE TO GO FOR MAINTENANCE You may have maintenance performed on your vehicle by any qualified person or facility. However, Toyota recommends having maintenance performed by an authorized Toyota dealership. Toyota dealership technicians are specially trained to maintain and repair Toyota vehicles. They stay current on the latest service information through Toyota technical bulletins, service publications and training courses. Many are also certified through the Toyota Certification Program, which involves a series of rigorous written examinations. Feel free to ask any Toyota dealership to show you their technicians credentials. You can be confident youre getting the best possible service for your vehicle when you take it to a Toyota dealership. 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 31134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 31 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM32 Your ResponsibilitiesWARRANTYOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE REPLACEMENT PARTS Warranty coverage is not dependent upon the use of any particular brand of replacement parts. However, Toyota recommends using only Toyota Genuine Parts when you need to replace a part on your vehicle. Like all Toyota products, Toyota Genuine Parts are built to the highest standards of quality, durability and performance. They are also designed to fit your vehicles exact specifications. Your Toyota dealership maintains an extensive inventory of Toyota Genuine Parts to meet your vehicle service needs. And because it is linked electronically to Toyotas Parts Distribution Centers, the dealership has quick access to any parts it may not have in stock. Toyota Genuine Parts are covered by their own warranty (see your dealer for details) or the remainder of any applicable New Vehicle Limited Warranty, whichever is longer. Parts that are not Toyota Genuine Parts, or any damage or failures resulting from their use, are not covered by any Toyota warranty. 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 32134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 32 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM33 Your ResponsibilitiesOBTAINING WARRANTY SERVICEWARRANTYBY GEOGRAPHIC REGION In the United States, U.S. Territories, Canada and Mexico To obtain warranty service in the United States, U.S. territories, Canada or Mexico, take your vehicle to an authorized Toyota dealership. If your vehicle cannot be driven, contact your nearest Toyota dealership for towing assistance. You do not have to pay for towing to the nearest Toyota dealership if your vehicle is inoperable due to failure of a warranted part. Outside the United States, U.S. Territories, Canada and Mexico If you are using your vehicle outside the United States, U.S. territories, Canada and Mexico and need warranty service, contact a local Toyota dealership. Please note, however, that your vehicle may not be repaired free of charge because the local Toyota distributor may have no obligation to provide warranty service for your vehicle, and/or your vehicle may not comply with local regulatory or environmental requirements.EMERGENCY REPAIRS If your vehicle is inoperable or unsafe to drive and there is no Toyota dealership reasonably available to make repairs, you may perform the repairs yourself or have them performed by another automotive service provider. Toyota will reimburse you for any of the repairs that are covered by warranty. To receive reimbursement, present to an authorized Toyota dealership your paid repair invoices and any parts that were removed from the vehicle. You will be reimbursed for warranted parts at the manufacturers suggested retail price and warranted labor at a geographically appropriate hourly rate multiplied by Toyotas recommended time allowance for the repair. If your vehicle requires emergency repair, Toyota assumes no liability for subsequent failures caused by improper repairs or the use of parts that are not Toyota Genuine Parts unless you have the vehicle properly repaired in a timely manner. To ensure that warranty coverage remains intact, have your vehicle inspected by an authorized Toyota dealership as soon as possible after an emergency repair. 134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 33134116_21-TCS-16245 Toyota Warranty and Maintenance Guide - MY23 Venza_R1.indd 33 9/14/22 4:27 AM9/14/22 4:27 AM34 Maintenance LogMAINTENANCETHE IMPORTANCE OF SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE Regular maintenance is essential to obtaining the highest level of performance, safety and reliability from your Toyota.

The distance from your vehicle to nearby obstacles when parallel parking or maneuvering into a garage is measured by sensors and communicated via the Multi-Information Display (MID) and/or the multimedia display and a buzzer. When the sensor detects an obstacle, the direction and the approximate distance to the obstacle are displayed on the MID and/or the multimedia display by illuminating continuously (far) or blinking (near), and beeping sounds will switch from intermittent to continuous as you approach and get closer to a detected obstacle. When the sensors detect two or more obstacles, the audible alerts will respond to the nearest zone. Always check the surrounding area when using this system.

TSS 2.5+ is designed to help support the drivers awareness, decision making and vehicle operation contributing to a safe driving experience. Refer to the Owners Manual for operation, setting adjustments, limitations and more details to understand these functions and complete safety precautions. For more information, please go to www.toyota.com/safety-sense.Quick overview-Toyota Safety Sense 2.5+ Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD) PCS w/PD is designed to provide alert, mitigation, and/or avoidance support in certain conditions, when the system determines there is potential for a collision with a detected object. The advanced grille-mounted radar system is designed to work with the forward-facing camera to help recognize a preceding vehicle, pedestrian or bicyclist in certain conditions. Automatic High Beams (AHB) AHB is designed to detect the headlights of oncoming vehicles and the taillights of preceding vehicles and switch between high beams and low beams as appropriate. Road Sign Assist (RSA)RSA is designed to recognize specific road signs using the forward-facing camera to provide information to the driver via the display.Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC)Full-Speed Range DRCC is designed to help maintain a pre-set distance to a preceding vehicle when the preceding vehicle is traveling at a lower speed. The minimum set speed is approximately 20 MPH. Lane Tracing Assist (LTA) SystemWhile driving on a road with clear white (yellow) lane lines, the LTA system warns the driver if the vehicle may deviate from the current lane or course, and also can slightly operate the steering wheel to help avoid deviation from the lane or course. Also, while the dynamic radar cruise control with full-speed range is operating, this system will operate the steering wheel to help maintain the vehicles lane position. Functions included in the LTA system are Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist, Vehicle Sway Warning and Lane Centering. MY23_Venza_QRG_V2_ML_0910_PRINT.indd 37 9/13/22 9:22 AM38Grille-mounted radarForward-facing cameraSensors TSS 2.5+ combines a forward-facing camera mounted in front of the inside rear view mirror and a grille-mounted radar mounted in the front grille. These sensors support the driving assist systems. The Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD) is designed to help detect a vehicle, bicyclist or a pedestrian in certain situations. Using both a camera and radar, PCS w/ PD can provide an audio/visual alert to warn you of a possible collision under certain circumstances. If you dont react, the system is designed to automatically brake. As there is a limit to the degree of recognition accuracy and control performance that this system can provide, do not overly rely on this system. This system will not prevent collisions or lessen collision damage or injury in every situation. Do not use PCS instead of normal braking operations under any circumstances. Do not attempt to test the operation of the Pre-Collision System yourself, as the system may not operate or engage, possibly leading to an accident. In some situations, such as when driving in inclement weather such as heavy rain, fog, snow or a sandstorm or while driving on a curve and for a few seconds after driving on a curve, a vehicle, pedestrian or bicyclist may not be detected by the radar and camera sensors, preventing the system from operating or engaging properly. See www.toyota.com/safety-sense for more information.Refer to the Toyota Owners Manual for a list of additional situations in which the system operation may be limited.Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/PD)TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE front grille-mounted radar\n",

Refer to the Toyota Owners Manual for additional limitations and information.Under certain conditions, the PCS included with the TSS 2.5+ package may also help to detect a pedestrian or bicyclist in front of your vehicle using the forward-facing camera and the front grille-mounted radar. The forward-facing camera of PCS detects a potential pedestrian or bicyclist based on size, profile, and motion of the detected pedestrian or bicyclist. However, a pedestrian or bicyclist may not be detected depending on the conditions, including the surrounding brightness and the motion, posture, size, and angle of the potential detected pedestrian or bicyclist, preventing the system from operating or engaging. PCS PEDESTRIAN DETECTIONPre-Collision WarningWhen the system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision is high, a buzzer will sound and a warning message will be displayed on the Multi-Information Display (MID) to urge the driver to take evasive action. Pre-Collision Brake Assist If the driver notices the hazard and brakes, the system may provide additional braking force using Brake Assist. This system may prime the brakes and may apply greater braking force in relation to how strongly the brake pedal is depressed. Pre-Collision Braking If the driver does not brake in a set time and the system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision with a preceding vehicle is extremely high, the system may automatically apply the brakes, reducing speed in order to help the driver reduce the impact and in certain cases avoid the collision.

If the system has not initialized turn off the light.Tire Pressure Monitoring (warning) (TPMS) *1 7-in display, *2Star Safety System ANTI-LOCK BRAKE SYSTEM (ABS) Toyotas Anti-lock Brake System detects which wheels are locking up and limits wheel lockup by pulsing each wheels brakes independently. Pulsing releases brake pressure repeatedly for fractions of a second. This helps the tires attain the traction that current road conditions will allow, helping you to stay in directional control. BRAKE ASSIST (BA) Brake Assist is designed to detect sudden or panic braking, and then add braking pressure to help decrease the vehicles stopping distance. When theres only a split second to react, Brake Assist can add additional brake pressure more quickly than just the driver alone can. ELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE DISTRIBUTION (EBD) Toyotas ABS technology has Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) to help maintain control and balance when braking. EBD responds to sudden stops by redistributing brake force to enhance the braking effectiveness of all four wheels.Your vehicle comes standard with the Star Safety System TM, which combines Anti- lock Braking System (ABS), Brake Assist (BA), Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Smart Stop Technology (SST), Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Traction Control (TRAC). Refer to the Owners Manual for more details and important information on limitations to these systems. SMART STOP TECHNOLOGY (SST) Smart Stop Technology automatically reduces engine power when the accelerator and brake pedals are pressed simultaneously under certain conditions. SST engages when the accelerator is depressed first and the brakes are applied firmly for longer than one-half second at speeds greater than five miles per hour. SST doesnt engage if the brake pedal is depressed before the accelerator pedal, allowing vehicles to start on a steep hill and safely accelerate without rolling backward. ENHANCED VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL (VSC) Enhanced Vehicle Stability Control provides cooperative control of the ABS, TRAC, VSC and EPS. Enhanced VSC helps to maintain directional stability when loss of traction occurs during a turn.

Install floor mats right side up.TRACTION CONTROL (TRAC) VSC helps prevent loss of traction during cornering by reducing engine power, and Traction Control helps maintain traction on loose gravel and wet, icy, or uneven surfaces by applying brake force to the spinning wheel(s). Toyotas TRAC sensors are activated when one of the drive wheels starts to slip. TRAC limits engine output and applies the brakes to the spinning wheel. This transfers power to the wheels that still have traction to help keep you on track.
